In physics, a power law, also known as a scaling law, is a functional relationship between two quantities, where one quantity varies as a power of another. Mathematically, it is expressed as "y = ax^b", where "y" and "x" are the quantities involved, "a" is a constant, and "b" is the exponent determining the power law behavior.

Power laws are characterized by the property that small changes in the independent variable "x" can result in large changes in the dependent variable "y", and vice versa. This makes power laws particularly useful in describing phenomena with scale invariance, where the same patterns or structures repeat at different scales.

In physics, power laws are encountered in various contexts, such as in the distribution of energy in turbulent flows, the sizes of earthquakes, the frequencies of words in natural languages, and the distribution of wealth in societies, among others. They provide insights into underlying mechanisms governing complex systems and are valuable tools for understanding the behavior of diverse phenomena across different scales.
